# Read Me for orbitalelementstoRV
orbitalelementstoRV is a variable converter that converts a position and velocity vector into its corresponding classical orbital elements, semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, right ascention, argument of perigee, ascending node, and true anomaly. This can also be done to convert these orbital elements back into position and velocity vectors.
## Status
### [Unreleased]
## Creator: A.Evans
### Created: 2023.20.02
## Last Editor: A. Evans
### Last Edited: 2023.29.10

## How to Use
- Download the [orbitalelementstoRV.zip] folder and extract its contents to your computer
- Call the functions RV2COE(R,V) and COE2RV(a,e,i,RA,w,nu,mu), replacing the variables with your position and velocity vectors, or your classical orbital elements, to receive the opposite, vectors or values.
